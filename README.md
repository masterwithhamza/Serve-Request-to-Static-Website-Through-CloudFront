This repository contains a project to host a static website using Amazon S3 and AWS CloudFront. The project covers:

S3 Bucket Configuration: Set up an S3 bucket to store and host static website files, including configuring bucket policies and permissions for public access.

CloudFront Distribution: Configure AWS CloudFront as a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to serve the static website, improving performance and scalability.

Domain Configuration: Optionally set up a custom domain with Route 53 and SSL/TLS certificates for secure access.

Caching and Optimization: Implement caching strategies and optimize content delivery for faster load times.

Access Logging: Enable logging to monitor website traffic and performance metrics.

This project provides hands-on experience in deploying a static website on AWS, leveraging S3 for storage and CloudFront for global content delivery, enhancing site performance and user experience.
